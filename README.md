# SNN
Asynchronous Spiking Neural Network Accelerator. Project from EE552-Asynchronous VLSI Design. 
• Fulfilled tree topology Network on Chip containing three-IO routers, three processing elements, one adder, and one memory.
• Complete modeling behavior of neurons to compute spikes and associated network in an asynchronous style without clock signal, cooperated with a teammate to complete whole complex architecture.
• Constructed asynchronous handshake communication by the interface to let multiple modules communicate and modified regular tree by decreasing unnecessary nodes to have a Hy-BTree in SystemVerilog.
